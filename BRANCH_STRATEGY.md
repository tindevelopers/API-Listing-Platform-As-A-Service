# Branch Strategy

This document outlines the branching strategy for the API-As-A-Service platform.

## Branch Structure

```
main (production)
├── staging (staging environment)
└── develop (development environment)
    ├── feature/new-feature
    ├── feature/bug-fix
    └── hotfix/critical-fix
```

## Branch Purposes

### **main** (Production)
- **Purpose**: Production-ready code
- **Environment**: Production deployment
- **Deployment**: Automatic on push to main
- **Protection**: Should require pull request reviews

### **staging** (Staging)
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **Environment**: Staging environment
- **Deployment**: Automatic on push to staging
- **Testing**: Integration testing, user acceptance testing

### **develop** (Development)
- **Purpose**: Active development
- **Environment**: Development environment
- **Deployment**: Automatic on push to develop
- **Testing**: Feature development, unit testing

## Workflow

### **Feature Development**
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Develop and test feature
3. Create pull request to `develop`
4. Merge to `develop` after review

### **Staging Deployment**
1. Merge `develop` to `staging`
2. Test in staging environment
3. Fix any issues found

### **Production Deployment**
1. Merge `staging` to `main`
2. Deploy to production
3. Monitor production environment

## Branch Protection Rules

### **main**
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Restrict pushes to main

### **staging**
- Require pull request reviews
- Require status checks to pass
- Allow force pushes (for hotfixes)

### **develop**
- Require pull request reviews
- Allow force pushes (for development)

## Current Branches

- ✅ **main**: Production branch
- ✅ **staging**: Staging branch (created from main)
- ✅ **develop**: Development branch (created from main)

## Next Steps

1. Set up branch protection rules in GitHub
2. Configure deployment workflows for each environment
3. Create feature branch templates
4. Set up automated testing for each branch
