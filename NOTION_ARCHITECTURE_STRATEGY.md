## 🔐 Security & Multi-Tenancy

### Data Isolation Strategy
```sql
-- Tenant isolation using tenant_id
CREATE TABLE listings (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    tenant_id UUID NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    category_id UUID,
    created_at TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP,
    INDEX idx_tenant_id (tenant_id)
);
```

### API Key Management
```json
{
  "tenant_id": "tenant-uuid",
  "api_key": "sk_live_...",
  "permissions": ["listings:read", "listings:write"],
  "rate_limit": 1000,
  "expires_at": "2025-12-31T23:59:59Z"
}
```
